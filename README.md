# Business Intelligence Solution for Retail Company – BI4ALL Case Study (2025)

This project presents an end-to-end **Business Intelligence (BI)** solution designed for a retail company as part of a challenge provided by **BI4ALL**. The goal was to build a **Self-Service BI system** to support strategic, tactical, and operational decisions through a full BI pipeline, from **Data Modeling** to **Reporting and Advanced Analytics**, using **Microsoft Fabric** and **Power BI**.

The solution was delivered in three phases: **Dimensional Modeling**, **ETL Implementation**, and **BI Reporting** — based on a real-world retail dataset with multiple years of transactional history.
